I want to work on a project that allows me to create a visual piano which plays chords passed in by a user in the console and songs passed in through a text file. <br>

I played a lot of classical piano growing up, not because I liked classical music, but because that's all I thought I could play on the piano.
When I discovered that I could play pop songs, songs that I actually knew, I stopped playing sheet music and started playing from guitar chords.
When I first started, I was overwhelmed by how many different chords there were and how many I had to memorize. With this application I hope to build, beginners will have an easier time learning the chords to their favorite songs visually.
<br>

In weeks 1 and 2, I will focus on coding the foundational data needed for the rest of my application. (i.e a map from chord names to notes, the visual piano, etc) and
allowing my application to take in user input and updating the visual piano to play the chords that the user inputs in real time.
In week 3, I will add a feature that allows my application to read text files of different songs and play the chords in those songs on the visual piano.

If I were to finish my project early, some extra stretch goals that I can implement include allowing the user to use the arrow keys to change the speed of the song playing 
or figuring out a way to play the sounds of given chords.
